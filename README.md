### Gemini API Key

This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. You will be prompted to enter your key when you first use the application.

**Security Note:** For development purposes, the API key is stored in `localStorage`. For a production environment, it is strongly recommended to use environment variables and a backend proxy to avoid exposing your API key on the client-side.
